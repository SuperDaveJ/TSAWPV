Two supervisors fired Anthony LaCalamita III on Thursday.  He returned to work the next Monday intending to kill the supervisors and anyone else who got in the way.</p>  <p>LaCalamita’s grievance derived from his termination from the accounting firm.</p>  <p>The ideation occurred when the fired employee decided to buy the 12-gauge shotgun to resolve his grievance.</p> <p>LaCalamita used his knowledge of the office layout and the location of each supervisor’s office to plan his attack.  He also planned the date and timing of the attack.</p> <p>LaCalamita prepared for the attack by purchasing the shotgun and a box of shells and arranging transportation to the office building.</p> <p>The breach occurred when LaCalamita returned to the company the Monday after he was fired and went directly to the offices of the two supervisors.</p> <p>In the attack, the aggressor wounded the two supervisors and killed the receptionist.</p> <p>In just a few days, the aggressor had nursed a grievance, developed the idea of using violence, conducted his research and planning, prepared for the attack, breached the company’s security, and launched the attack.</p>";
