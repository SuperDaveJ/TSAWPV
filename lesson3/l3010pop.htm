Police today arrested Lee P. McPhatter on assault charges after he allegedly pushed down, and then kicked, a Sesame Place theme park employee dressed as Cookie Monster.  The employee suffered bruised ribs and a cervical sprain.  McPhatter told police that Cookie Monster twice refused to pose for a picture with McPhatter’s daughter and that the character 'aggressively' put a big blue paw on his daughter’s head and pushed her. The spokesperson for Sesame Place stated, 'Our characters do not act the way this man said.  It is an honor to be Cookie Monster.'</p>  <p>In this lesson, you will learn that violence is the result of a process that involves a sequence of behaviors that build one on another.</p><p>The paths leading to a violent act involve recognizable behaviors.  These behaviors serve as warning signs.  Knowing and understanding the types of behaviors associated with workplace violence will help you recognize any warning signs you may witness.  Reporting these warning signs to the proper authorities represents an essential part of preventing workplace violence. </p>";
