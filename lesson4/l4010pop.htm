Police arrested a fired nuclear power plant mechanic for allegedly threatening his former co-workers.  The police found a stockpile of over 250 firearms in the mechanic's house and storage shed.  A former co-worker told police that the mechanic said, 'They have taken my job, they have taken my life.  I'll take my guns and go to San Onofre and whack a bunch of people.'</p>  <p>April 19, CHESTERFIELD, SC. 'Parents Foil Plot to Bomb South Carolina High School.'  Police arrested 18-year-old Ryan Schallenberger after his parents reported that he had purchased 10 pounds of ammonium nitrate off the Internet.  A search of the high school student’s room led to the discovery of a hate-filled journal complaining that the 'rich handsome boys got to date all the pretty girls' and praising the Columbine killers. Police also found an audiotape he wanted played after his death and a year’s worth of plans for the bombing, including hand-drawn maps of the high school.  The discovery was made the day before the anniversary of the Columbine rampage.</p>  <p>Preventing workplace violence requires everyone's commitment and involvement.  The workers at the San Onofre Nuclear Power Plant who reported their former co-worker’s threats and the parents of the high school student who reported his purchase of the bomb-making materials averted disaster by recognizing the potential for violence and by reporting it to the proper authorities. As the two newspaper reports amply demonstrate, violence can be prevented if we take the warning signs seriously. In each case, the aggressor had clearly reached the Preparation step along the path to intended violence.  For both aggressors, the next steps would have been Breaching Security, then Attacking.  Instead, because the mechanic's co-worker took his threats seriously and the student's parents grew concerned about the purchase of materials that could be used for bomb-making, both plans ended at the Preparation step before any violence occurred. </p>";
