The four types are criminals, customers, employees, and domestic partners. Since TSA’s mission is to prevent criminal attacks against transportation, the focus of this training will center on the other three types of aggressors and how they affect the TSA workplace.</p> <p>Select each picture below to learn about a different workplace aggressor. Once you have learned about each kind of aggressor, you can select the next button to continue with the lesson.</p>";

arrPopup[2]  = "<p class='popupH'>Customer Aggressor</p> <p>Workplace violence involving a customer aggressor occurs when a customer or client poses a threat to a TSA employee or worksite.</p> <p><b>Example 1:</b> A Transportation Security Officer (TSO) could politely ask a passenger to remove her shoes and place them on the x-ray conveyor belt. The passenger could become aggravated and respond by throwing her shoes at the TSO.</p> <p><b>Example 2:</b> A Transportation Security Inspector (TSI) could issue an Enforcement Investigative Report (EIR) to a known shipper who had violated security regulations. The shipper could later call the TSI and threaten to kill the inspector.</p>";

arrPopup[3]  = "<p class='popupH'>Employee Aggressor</p> <p>Workplace violence involving an employee aggressor occurs when a present or former TSA employee poses a threat to current TSA employees, customers, or TSA worksites.</p> <p><b>Example 1:</b> A TSA employee might threaten to kill his supervisor after the supervisor reprimands him for chronic tardiness.</p> <p><b>Example 2:</b> An employee might feel threatened if a co-worker reaches out her arm to point at something and her arm goes in front of the employee’s face. The employee could respond by shoving the co-worker.</p>";

arrPopup[4]  = "<p class='popupH'>Domestic Partner Aggressor</p>  <p>Workplace violence involving a domestic partner aggressor occurs when an employee’s domestic problems spill into the workplace. The aggressor may not work for TSA, but currently has, previously had, or wants a personal relationship with a TSA employee.</p> <p><b>Example 1:</b> An employee’s estranged spouse could show up at the employee’s workplace and attack the employee.</p> <p><b>Example 2:</b> An employee’s ex-spouse could begin calling the employee frequently and hanging up. The ex-spouse might then wait in a car outside the employee’s workplace in order to follow the employee home.</p>";
