Then answer the following two questions.</p> <p>A month ago Betty, a Program Analyst at a TSA field office, left her husband Paul, over his strenuous objections.  She did not tell anyone at work.</p>  <p>Three weeks ago, Paul confronted Betty outside the field office, saying, “You are mine and you will always be mine and no one else’s!\"</p> <p>A week later, as Betty drove home from work, she thought she saw Paul following her to her new apartment.</p> <p>A few days later, one of Betty’s co-workers, who had witnessed the argument outside the field office, told Betty he had seen her husband at a local gun shop buying a pistol.  The co-worker asked Betty, “Is everything okay at home?” Out of embarrassment, Betty said, “Everything’s fine.” After hearing about the gun purchase, Betty obtained a temporary restraining order against Paul.</p> <p>Today marks a month since their separation.  In the morning, Betty arrives at the field office.  As she gets out of her car, out of the corner of her eye she sees Paul running toward her.  Betty, yelling for help, runs toward the office.</p> <p>Paul fires twice at his wife, hitting her in the back and killing her.</p>";

Intended acts of violence occur as planned, thought-out attacks on specific targets.</p> <p>Try again!</p>";

arrPopup[4]  = "<p class='popupH'>Incorrect!</p> <p>The correct answer is intended violence because Paul targeted his wife and planned the attack.</p>";
