                    <p><b>I’m an Employee: How can I use the structure TSA is building for the ICMS?</b></p>
                    
                    <p>In a Model Workplace, everyone has the ability and the responsibility to raise issues, concerns and ideas and to respond to conflict respectfully and constructively. TSA’s <b>I</b>ntegrated <b>C</b>onflict <b>M</b>anagement <b>S</b>ystem (ICMS) provides <b>skills, structure, and support</b> so that any kind of issue can be raised with confidence that it will be respectfully heard and responsibly dealt with.  The Structure of an ICMS includes all the places and ways you can raise and address issues and concerns.</p>
					<p><i>Read below to learn about the Places and Ways you can raise issues and concerns:</i>	
                    <br /><i>I Can Deal With it on My Own </i>
                    <br /><i>I Can Get Help </i>
                    <br /><i>I Can Turn it over to Someone Else to Decide</i>
                    <p><b>I Can Deal With it on My Own</b></p>
                    <p>Have you’ve faced situations like these?</p>
                    <p>Difficult conversations:</p>
                    <p>you’ve had a disagreement with a coworker - it’s no big deal, but the two of you aren’t getting along as well as you used to.  You want to patch it up.</p>
                    <p>you have a special event coming up and need to switch your shift. You’re not sure how to approach your co-worker or your supervisor</p>
                    <p>you’re a manager struggling with preparing to have a difficult conversation with an employee or a peer</p>
                    <p>you just don’t feel that anyone is listening to you</p>
                    
                    <p>Glitches in ‘the system’:</p>
                    <p>you’ve noticed a problem at a checkpoint and want a confidential way to raise it.</p>
                    <p>you’ve tried to solve a problem or make a request through the system several times before without getting a response</p>
                    <p>A key to a successful outcome is to raise an issue or concern early before it becomes more serious.  Although most often we like to try to handle these kinds of situations ourselves, sometimes we need:  someone to listen; an opportunity to gain a different perspective; to discuss options for resolution; or to be referred to a place or person that can address our concern.  In this section we will list some of the places and ways available to you at TSA. You have a number of options: make sure you know what’s available in your office or airport before you decide which option you’ll use.</p>
                    
                    <p><b>Places and Ways</b></p>
                    <p>A good place to start:</p>
                    <p><b>Conversation:</b> A good place to start is by having a conversation using the 4Rs.  The 4Rs are based on <span class="colorText">cooperative problem solving</span>.</p>
                    <p>Eventually, every TSA employee will receive training in the 4Rs.</p>
                    <p>The 4 R’s mean speaking and listening respectfully, recognizing differences,  sharing responsibility for addressing issues, and collaborating to resolve them.  Cooperative problem solving provides the foundation for good relationships, good decisions and good conflict management.</p>
                    <p><b>Line Management:</b> Immediate supervisors should be the primary resource for workplace issues and conflicts.</p>
                    <p><b><span class="colorText">Conflict Coaching</span></b> - Your airport or office may have Peer Conflict Coaches. Coaches are TSA employees specially trained in coaching and cooperative problem solving. As a collateral duty they are available for listening; referring you to another place if appropriate; helping you develop options; and practicing how to raise or resolve concerns.  The coaching process is confidential and neutral - coaches do not serve as advocates for any person or position.</p>
                    <p>Here are some places to turn to if you choose to handle the issue or concern on your own:</p>
                    
                    <p><b><span class="colorText">Office of the Ombudsman</span> 1-877-266-2837:</b> You can turn to the Ombudsman when you need a confidential, independent and neutral resource that answers inquiries, facilitates communications, and helps employees identify their options to resolve workplace concerns.</p>
                    <p><b><span class="colorText">Employee Assistance Program (EAP)</span> 1-800-222-0364:</b> TSA's EAP provides short-term counseling and resource and referral services to employees and their family members.  EAP services are convenient and confidential.</p>
                    <p>Your airport or office may also have:</p>
                    <p><b>Concern Forms</b> provide an opportunity to identify an issue or concern for those who do not feel confident or comfortable enough to raise an issue up the chain of command.</p>
                    <p><b>Suggestion Programs</b> provide an opportunity for front-line employees to submit suggestions for improving procedures or processes. </p>
                    
                  <p><b>I CAN GET HELP</b> </p>
                  <p><b>"Looking into it."</b> Your supervisor, the management staff, and the Office of the Ombudsman can sometimes “look into it” for you, get you more information, and explore options to help address your issue or concern.</p>
                  <p><b>Line Management</b> should always be the primary resource for workplace issues and conflicts.</p>
                  <p>Here are some other places that have been created by TSA for employees to turn to for handling issues or concerns with someone else’s assistance:</p>
                  <p><b><span class="colorText">Office of Civil Rights</span> (OCR) 1-877-EEO-4TSA:</b> For complaints involving allegations of unlawful discrimination and harassment in accordance with federal laws, Executive Orders, and policies, any TSA employee can seek the assistance of an OCR counselor. OCR Counselors can guide you in the Informal EEO process and are the way to access OCR’s mediation program, ARC.</p>
                  <p><b><span class="colorText">Office of the Ombudsman</span> 1-877-266-2837:</b> The Ombudsman provides a confidential, independent and neutral resource that answers inquiries, facilitates communications, and helps employees identify their options to resolve workplace concerns.</p>

                  <p><b>The TSA Ethics Office</b> provides advice and training to TSA employees regarding an employee’s personal conduct and potential conflicts of interest, such as the acceptance of gifts, fundraising, misuse of position or government property, but does not investigate allegations of ethics violations. For ethics advice, contact your field counsel or a TSA Headquarters ethics official.</p>
                  <p><b>Model Workplace Program Office:</b> You can talk to your supervisor or manager about getting help from a mediator to resolve a conflict that has become difficult to handle without help from someone who is neutral. <span class="colorText">Mediation</span> is a voluntary, structured process in which a trained neutral person assists facilitates a discussion between two or more parties. The mediator is responsible for the process.  The mediator does not decide issues. Mediators may be requested by your management from the Model Workplace Office.  If your issue involves a claim of unlawful discrimination or harassment, please refer to the Office of Civil Rights (OCR) listed above.</p>
                  <p>Other places and ways that may be available at your airport:</p>
                  <p>Your airport or office might have an <span class="colorText">Employee Council</span>.

               		<p>Your airport or office might have a <span class="colorText">Safety Action Team</span> (SAT) for making sure there is good two-way communication on health and safety issues.</p>
                    
                  <p><b>I CAN TURN IT OVER TO SOMEONE ELSE TO DECIDE</b> </p>
                  <p>Here are Places where employees can ask a third party to resolve their issue or concern:</p>
                  <p><b><span class="colorText">Office of Civil Rights (OCR)</span>1-877-EEO-4TSA:</b> For complaints involving allegations of unlawful discrimination and harassment in accordance with federal laws, Executive Orders, and policies, OCR counselors provide fair and impartial processing and resolution of complaints during  the informal stage of the EEO process.

                  <p>Employees may initiate the <b>Grievance Process</b> if they are dissatisfied with some aspect of their employment at TSA subject to the control of management provided the issue is not excluded from the coverage of that process under the Grievance Policy (See TSA Management Directive No. 1100.77-2.)</p>

                  <p><b><span class="colorText">Disciplinary Review Board (DRB)</span>:</b>  This board is an option for TSA screeners who have received serious disciplinary actions. The Board will review employee claims and render a decision based on the facts provided by the employee and management. (See <span class="colorText">Management Directive No. 1100.77-1</span> (PDF 267KB) )</p>

It's important that teams identify and target any problems before they escalate. At the end of this course you'll have the skills needed to recognize why teams stop working, identify why battles begin, learn how to target team problems, and develop the skills to discuss problems as a team.<br />Duration=2.5</p></td>

                          Description: No one can complete a working career without experiencing conflict, so it is essential for you to handle this conflict in the most effective way. To handle conflict well, you need to build up a repertoire of techniques. These techniques require you to behave differently from your natural instincts at times. Therefore, a good starting point is to establish what your instinctive approaches to conflict are, and where these attitudes stem from. This will enable you to decide on a range of different approaches to conflict, based on a spectrum that goes from being only concerned about your own needs, to only being concerned about other people's needs. This spectrum gives rise to five possible strategies for dealing with conflict. Whatever strategy you apply, some core techniques will make you more effective. These involve three main actions: confronting the conflict, communicating with the other party, and determining an acceptable outcome. Sometimes, the conflict in the workplace just surrounds you, even though you are not involved directly. You then have to learn how to avoid taking sides, or becoming a scapegoat.

                          Description: As a manager, you will inevitably have to sort out some of the conflict that occurs in your organization. Sometimes, this will be between individuals, but often it will be between teams, and even departments. The different nature of these conflicts is likely to require different approaches, and there are also likely to be a range of particular demands on you in the way that you manage the conflicts. A way of differentiating and applying these approaches is by adopting a short-term approach against a longer-term strategy. The first is categorized by a -quick and dirty- style of containment and reduction. <br />
The second is characterized by approaches that are concerned with resolving the roots of the conflict by finding structural remedies to prevent the conflict occurring in the future. Another form of a long-term approach is to attempt to prevent conflict from occurring. This is, of course, probably impossible, but this approach is characterized by considering in what ways a manager can act to discourage negative conflict. Duration=6.0

                          <strong>Description:</strong> What is meant by the term -conflict,- and what are the general attitudes towards it in the workplace? In this course, three prevailing attitudes towards conflict are compared. These are that:<br />
                          --Conflict is always a bad thing <br />
                          --Conflict is always a good thing <br />
                          --A certain level of conflict is productive, but too much is undesirable. 
This last view informs the rest of the course, which goes on to describe how a healthy and productive level of conflict can be encouraged in an organization, promoting a win-win philosophy that improves performance. Of course, conflict cannot always be contained at this productive level, and often spills over into becoming destructive. Therefore, learners will also discover how to recognize the signs and symptoms of destructive conflict, so that they can deal with it in the workplace. Duration=5.5

                        <strong>Description:</strong> Teams are a fact of corporate life. Think about all the team buzzwords. There are cross-functional teams, self-directed teams, union teams, functional teams, total quality teams, and project teams--not to mention the concept of -The Dream Team.- If there's anything that's predictable about these high-powered teams, it's the inevitability of conflict.

What do you need to know about the roots of conflict and team dynamics to help cultivate a healthy mindset about conflict?
