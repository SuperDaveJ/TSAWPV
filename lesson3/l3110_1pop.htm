The bag’s owner watches quietly with his lips pursed.</p> <p>It seems that you have personal toiletries in your bag that exceed the limit.  Is there anyone outside of Security that you could give these to?</p> <p>No! This is stupid! I’m already late because of this ridiculous security line and now you expect me to get out of line to give my stuff to someone?  If you keep treating people this way, somebody’s going to get hurt.</p> <p>Give me my bag!</p> <p>The passenger tries to yank his bag out of Scott’s hands.</p> <p>The passenger shoves the bag at Scott, hitting him in the chest.</p>";
