      <p class="style8"> You will need Internet Explorer 5.5 (or above) and a standard video player,  such as Windows Media Player, to run the course.

      <p class="style8"> You can enter and exit the course as many times as you want without losing  anything. When you log in for the first time, the computer puts a &ldquo;cookie&rdquo; on  your computer. This means that the program will remember you the next time you  log in. The course will automatically start where you last were in the course  material. Make sure you use the same computer &ndash; if you don&rsquo;t, there is no  &ldquo;cookie&rdquo; on the computer and you will have to start over.</p>
