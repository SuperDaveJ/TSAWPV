Self-control is essential so that interactions between employees and customers don’t spiral out of control and erupt in impromptu violence.</p><p>The potential for impromptu violence is great when a person doesn't get what he or she wants and becomes emotional.  These emotions can quickly turn to anger and frustration, and then to violence.</p><p>When dealing with someone who is becoming angry and increasingly frustrated, how you respond can either add fuel to the argument, causing it to spiral towards violence, or can prevent violence from erupting. </p><p>There is no one correct way to resolve a potentially violent incident.  How you respond very much depends on the aggressor's behavior and the overall situation.  Methods include:</p> <p><ul><li>Exercising restraint and being aware of your own feelings and emotions so that you don't escalate the situation<li>Communicating in a respectful manner</li><li>Being flexible and cooperative</li><li>Calling for assistance</li><li>Reporting the situation to the local WVP Coordinator or your Supervisor</li></ul></p> <p>Select each image to listen to some other possible methods for decreasing the likelihood of violence in the workplace.</p>";
