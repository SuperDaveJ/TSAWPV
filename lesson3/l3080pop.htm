Mack explained that he was not upset at being fired, but at the way in which the company informed him of the termination.  Rather than calling him or visiting him in person, the union representative and supervisor sent him a letter. After working at the company for 24 years, Mack felt he deserved a more personal touch than a mere letter.</p> <p>Additional audio 2.<br />Sal, a Mexican citizen, knew he was destined to become the King of California.  He repeatedly showed up at the Governor’s office demanding to take over.  During the inauguration ceremony for the new Governor in January 1999, security officers caught Sal in the Capitol Rotunda armed with a 9-inch knife and a newspaper picture of the new Governor.  Sal returned to the Capitol in May 2002 and February 2003.</p> <p>Additional audio 3.<br />In videotapes made prior to their deadly rampage at Columbine High School, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold talked about how the attack would make them famous.</p>"
