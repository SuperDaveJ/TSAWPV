Lesson 2 introduced you to the spectrum of behaviors that must be reported, including inappropriate references to weapons, violence and terrorism.</p> <p>Since TSA secures the nation’s transportation systems against acts of terrorism, we can expect TSA employees to discuss firearms, bombs, terrorism, terrorist acts, weapons of mass destruction, and other forms of violence as part of their normal duties.  The key, then, is to distinguish when these types of conversations are appropriate and when they are inappropriate.  Employees must report the inappropriate comments.</p> <p>Listen to each situation and think about which conversation is an appropriate statement in the workplace.</p> <p>John, a Supervisory Transportation Security Officer (STSO), spoke with Nick, another TSA employee, at the checkpoint. They talked about a recent briefing on the July 7, 2005 London bombings.  John, the STSO, stated, “The suicide bombers were really effective in coordinating the bomb blasts right in the middle of rush hour.”  “Yeah,” Nick replied, “not only did it cause disruption of the city’s transportation systems, it was also the largest and deadliest terrorist attack on London in its history.”</p> <p>John, a Supervisory Transportation Security Officer (STSO), spoke with Nick, another TSA employee, at the checkpoint.  He commented, “I’m sick and tired of all these people who complain about TSA invading their privacy, causing delays, and saying TSA is doing a bad job.”  Nick replied, “I know what you mean.  I've even thought about building a small improvised explosive device to put in someone's bag.  Then the public would remember how important TSA's role is.”</p> <p>The conversation between the TSA employees regarding the London bombings is an appropriate conversation in the workplace because TSA is responsible for finding and stopping threats to transportation security. So no report should be made.</p> <p>The conversation that included the threat to use an improvised explosive devise against the people who criticize TSA is an inappropriate conversation. John should report that conversation to his Supervisor or the local WVP Coordinator.</p>";
